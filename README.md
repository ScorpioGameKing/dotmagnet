# How to use

DotðŸ§²Magnet is incredibly simple to use, be careful about running this right away as it will attempt to install the provided
example installation files:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ScorpioGameKing/dotmagnet
cd dotmagnet
./install.sh install
```

# How to Make Your Own

Any bash file placed in the `installers/` directory by default will be run by the installer. It's highly recomended to
enforce some form of ordering so that your files will install in the correct order. To use the helper functions provided
by DotðŸ§²Magnet add the following snippet near the top of your file:

```sh
# Bring in our installer functions
function_dir=./../functions
parent_dir="$(builtin cd "$function_dir"; pwd)"
source "$parent_dir/functions/installer_functions.sh"
```

As for accessing menus, import them by adding the following if you haven't already imported `installer_functions`:

```sh
# Bring in our menus
menu_dir=./../menus
parent_dir="$(builtin cd "$menu_dir"; pwd)"
source "$parent_dir/menus/menus.sh"
```

Please see the files in `functions/` and `menus/` for further information on what functions and menus are provided and 
how to use them.
